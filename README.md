Package flagstruct allows flags to be defined by struct tags and automatically
filled into a struct.

For a flag to be registered the field must be exported, of a supported type,
and have a flag struct tag.

The package example covers most variations.

##Flag struct tag format
The flag struct tag format is

```
flag:"name,default-value,description"
```

If name is omitted, the field's name is used, lowercased, with _ replaced by -.

If default-value is omitted, the appropriate zero value is used.

If description is omitted, the empty string is used.

If all are omitted the tag may be just:

```
flag:""
```

If you need to use commas in the default-value, you can change the separator
used by <rune>:<specification>.
For example,

```
flag:"|:name|a,b,c|description"
flag:"::name:a,b,c:description"
flag:"⊕:name⊕a,b,c⊕description"
```

##Supported Types
Supported types are:

```
string
bool
int
int64
uint
uint64
float64
```

Or any type whose underlying type is one of the above.
A type whose underlying type is one of the above is treated as that type,
with the sole exception of a time.Duration which is handled as a time.Duration.

Types whose field is exported are scanned for flags as well.
